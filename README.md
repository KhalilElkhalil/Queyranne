# Queyranne
Here, we implement Queyranne's algorithm which is a completely combinatorial approach for symmetric submodular minimization. This is a very useful algorithm for clustering based on submodular minimization among other applications. We implement the code for an instance of submodular functions given by the log det function applied on positive definite matrices. 
The implementation is entirely based on Queyranne's paper in Mathematical programming.
